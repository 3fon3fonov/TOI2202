This is a repository of the TOI-2202 paper by [Trifonov et al. (2021b)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210805323T/abstract).

It contains an Exo-Striker (ver. 0.63) clone with the needed RV and photometry data to reproduce the results from the paper. However, the ES sessions do not include the posterior samples since these take approx 900 Mb of disc memory, and thus Github is not appropriate storage. I can distribute these upon request or can be reproduced with the ES.
